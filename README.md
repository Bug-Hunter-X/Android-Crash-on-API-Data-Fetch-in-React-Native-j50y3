# React Native Android Crash on API Data Fetch

This repository demonstrates a bug in a React Native application where fetching data from a remote API causes a crash on Android devices, but works correctly on iOS.  The issue is subtle and related to how network responses and JSON parsing are handled.  The solution involves improving error handling and potentially modifying how the JSON response is processed.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the application on both an Android emulator/device and an iOS simulator/device.
4. Observe the different behavior on each platform. 

## Solution

The solution is outlined in the `bugSolution.js` file, which includes detailed changes and explanations for improved error handling and robust JSON processing.  The key was to add more robust error checking and handling for edge cases in the network response and JSON parsing.
